      <h5>Question One</h5>
      <div class="section" id="q1">
        <p>What is the frequencies of use across bikes?</p>
        <canvas id="q1chart" width="200" height="80"></canvas>
        <p>
          The distribution of bike use frequencies is relatively even for most bikes, but trailing off on either end
          in an S-shaped curve. Ideally, you would want a uniform distribution, so as to allocate resources (bikes) evenly
          across LA. Interestingly, the bike corresponding to 4727 has particularly a lot of uses (312) during the time interval
          when data was recorded, to be specific over 30 more than the next most used bike. -- SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT DIST. --

      <div class="section" id="q1p2">
        <p>What is the average time for a bike ride?</p>
        <canvas id="q1time" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
        <p>
          The mean was approximately 14.58 minutes. <br>
          Due to the long tail, this mean may not be as good of a reading of the average as the median (approximately 10 minutes).<br>
          There were plenty of crazy outliers, bike rides lasting for more than 1000 minutes. I decided not to include those into
          the distribution, as it simply seemed too unreasonable. I cut off the total minutes at 100, as minutes past that count 
          were only frequented once.

      <div class="section" id="q1p3">
        <p>Which month has the most bike rides?</p>
        <canvas id="q1month" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
        <p>
          We don't have bike data from the summer months, but we can see that generally the most bike rides occurred in August, 
          trailing off going into the winter seasons.

      <div class="section" id="q2">
        <h5>Question Two</h5>
        <p>Which start/stop stations are most popular?</p>
        <canvas id="q2bar" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
        <p>
          Stations 3069, 3030, 3005, 3064, 3031 are the most popular stations to start at.<br>
          On the other hand, stations 3005, 3031, 3014, 3042, 3069 are the most popular stations to end at.<br>
          Interestingly enough, the top ending station frequencies are far higher than those of the starting stations.
          This may be due to travellers beginning from relatively more dispersed areas of LA, but largely transporting 
          to severalpopular stations in hot areas of LA.

        <h5>Question Three</h5>
        <p>What is the average distance traveled?</p>
        <canvas id="q3line" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
        <p>
          The average distance for each trip turned out to be approximately 0.734 miles.<br>
          However, the mean is distorted by a long tail in the distribution, so the median (0.662 miles)
          may be a more accurate approximation of the average.

      <a name="q4link"></a>
      <div class="section" id="q4">
        <h5>Question Four</h5>
        <p>How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?</p>
        <canvas id="q4chart" width="200" height="50"></canvas>
        <p>
          Assuming that any rider not categorized as 'Walk-Up' uses bike sharing as a regular
          part of their commute, and that each trip was a different rider, approximately 
          68.87% of riders uses bike sharing regularly.</p>
