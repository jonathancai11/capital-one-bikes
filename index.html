      <h5>What is the frequencies of use across bikes?</h5>
      <div class="section" id="q1">
        <canvas id="q1chart" width="200" height="80"></canvas>
        <p>
          The distribution of bike use frequencies is relatively even for most bikes, but trailing off on either end
          in an S-shaped curve. Ideally, you would want a uniform distribution, so as to allocate resources (bikes) evenly
          across LA. Interestingly, the bike corresponding to 4727 has particularly a lot of uses (312) during the time interval
          when data was recorded, to be specific over 30 more than the next most used bike. On the other hand, there exists bike
          number 1349, which has accumulated only 1 ride over the entire data set. While there certainly are outliers, the 
          bike company here appears to be doing a good job dispersing bikes across LA to optimize usage.

      <div class="section" id="q1p2">
        <h5>What is the average time for a bike ride?</h5>
        <br>
        <canvas id="q1time" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
        <p>
          The mean was approximately 14.58 minutes. <br>
          Due to the long tail, this mean may not be as good of a reading of the average as the median (approximately 10 minutes).<br>
          There were plenty of crazy outliers, bike rides lasting for more than 1000 minutes. I decided not to include those into
          the distribution, so as to give a more constructive visual representation of this data. 
          Thus, I cut off the total minutes at 100, as minutes past that count were only frequented once.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section" id="q1p3">
        <h5>Which month has the most bike rides?</h5>
        <br>
        <canvas id="q1month" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
        <p>
          We don't have bike data from the summer months, but we can see that generally the most bike rides occurred in August, 
          trailing off going into the winter seasons. However, there might be issues with the accuracy of this distribution,
          because data was gathered in both 2016 and 2017, and there might be overlap in the fall months, leading to distortion.
          I think it would be more interesting to see data across all months of a single year, so as to see the potential rise and fall
          across different seasons.

      <a name="q2link"></a>
      <div class="section" id="q2">
        <h5>Which start/stop stations are most popular?</h5>
        <br>
        <canvas id="q2bar" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
        <p>
          Stations 3069, 3030, 3005, 3064, 3031 are the most popular stations to start at.<br>
          On the other hand, stations 3005, 3031, 3014, 3042, 3069 are the most popular stations to end at.<br>
          Interestingly enough, the top ending station frequencies are far higher than those of the starting stations.
          This may hint at the hypothesis that travellers begin from relatively more dispersed areas of LA, but ride bikes 
          to fewer popular stations in hot areas of LA.

      <a name="q3link"></a>
      <div class="section" id="q3">
        <h5>What is the average distance traveled?</h5>
        <br>
        <canvas id="q3line" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
        <p>
          The average distance for each trip turned out to be approximately 0.734 miles.<br>
          However, the mean is distorted by a long tail in the distribution, so the median (0.662 miles)
          may be a more accurate approximation of the average.<br>
          Currently, I am only considering One-Way trips; there is no data for individual bikers 
          to accurately infer an average trip distance travelled for the same biker.

      <a name="q4link"></a>
      <div class="section" id="q4">
        <h5>How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?</h5>
        <br>
        <canvas id="q4chart" width="200" height="50"></canvas>
        <p>
          Assuming that any rider not categorized as 'Walk-Up' uses bike sharing as a regular
          part of their commute, and that each trip was a different rider, approximately 
          68.87% of riders uses bike sharing regularly. This splits up into a large majority of 
          61.4% using the Monthly Pass, and 7.2% using the Flex Pass.
